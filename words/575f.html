<p>At the beginning of this year, as a new Ph.D. student in a new campus, a new country, I experienced a hard time, I call it “hard” because it really made me helpless and confused sometimes. The worst thing is that I have almost no assistant to handle the problems I meet, like rental issues or residence documents. So, I actually don’t have a very good and smooth start. At that time, I need to ride to the university every day, it took me about one hour on the road. No matter raining or wind, I tried to do that like a normal student, but that was really tired of me, especially for a young man that didn’t make food by himself before. So, in order to simplify the eating, I start to eat at school, and bread, sandwiches, or hamburgers became my main food. Recall those days, I still could feel that kind of feeling: not tasty but I can eat them all, just for feeding. [↑]</p>
<p>The next thing I want to share those days is “school time”, what’s this mean? simple! just attend lessons and lectures like a normal student. Sounds weird right, because long darkness will come in two months later. So, I can say that I have been here for about one and a half years, but I just experienced less than half a year of student life. In January, I attended the introduction course of Ph.D. and met some friends, some of them are also the classmate of my other courses. This kind of life did not keep for a long time as I said, since the beginning of March, the Covid-19 came here as all people predicted, the only question is how to deal with it. I think the government here made some absolute wrong actions at the beginning, which makes the situation become worse and worse at a fast speed. Finally, it caused the government had to lock down all public facilities and keep people work at home. [↑]</p>

<p>So, from March, I totally became a home-study student, no friends can meet, no communications with others face to face, all things I can do is to stay at home and play &amp; study with my computer. The good news is that I start to love making food at that time. I tried to make many kinds of dishes, to be honest, I’m amazed about my abilities. Some food tasted not bad, that makes me have a belief that I can have a good life even I live alone. I didn’t try this before since Chinese universities provide all services for students. [↑]</p>
<p>One another thing I need to mention is the hoster of my first rental place. He is a Pakistani and very like me cause I’m Chinese, I wrote some words about him in the summary of 2019, but I spent another four months with him in 2020, and we have a good time, he agreed to short the contract so that I can move out to the place that I live in now. Sometimes we will talk about some international news, he really likes to talk about the relationships between Pakistan and China, and always to say some bad words about India. That’s finny and in another perspective, it also a situation that I practice my English speaking. [↑]</p>

<p>I formally moved into the new place on May 1st. I admit that I’m happy and very satisfied with everything here at the beginning. But after the other roommate back to china, I become the only one that lives here with an old couple. I’ll write about this later, now,  let’s just keep good memories now.  [↑]</p>
<p>The first thing I need to emphasize is the environment. The house is located near a river and close to a big commercial center. It’s really convenient to live here, and I also found a badminton club here. In that summer, the most expected thing for me is to play badminton with my roommate in the club. I can say I spent an excellent summer, this is no doubt! [↑]</p>

<p>The other is food! That old Chinese couples are really like making food at home. Since they are moving here for living together with their daughter, in some terms, they don’t have any activities here so that making food becomes their main task every day. As the picture shows, I ate a lot of Chinese food here, can you imagine? They came from northeastern china and I finished my Master’s degree in Shenyang, so the food really makes me feel I was still live in China! [↑]</p>

<p>Time goes to the end of summer, one of my friends suggest us to travel someplace since he will back to Chine soon. Finally, we determined to go to the Texel island, we just spent one day that arrives there, play, and come back. Although just one day, it still very impressive for me, for all of us, we met the most beautiful sunset,  we saw the ocean for the first time. And I’m glad to hear that my friends give me a high recommendation for my photography skills. This is the first time for me to bring my camera to travel with others, and I do make some wonderful photos of the landscapes. [↑]</p>

<p>After that travel, we never go out anymore, but we still try to take some chances to meet each other face to face. In October, an important time point came out, I met a friend that lived in an urban apartment. With his help, I met another five friends! They all lived in that apartment, which made me determine to move there. Till now, we have already met about ten times, I admire the room they lived in, which is very big, clean and comfortable. From that time, I made a decision that I do will move here and live with them! [↑]</p>
<p>Now, at the end of February, I did it! In the past week, I got the chance to book a very ideal room in that apartment, and the more lucky thing is that I also booked another room for my colleague! That’s an impossible task: book two rooms in one week! I’m already prepared to move there to start my new life. To be honest, I’m enough with the life that living with that old couples, now I fully understand why young people shouldn’t live with their parents. Not because of the rules, but the feelings of control, they want to “care about” all things about you, which is totally invading your own zones. For example, can you imagine the hoster move some useless furniture to your room even you say no! Can you imagine that the hoster enter your locked-door room and “clean &amp; rearrange” your room! That’s what I experienced, I know they have no bad purpose to do them, but they are disturbing my own life, I’m just a renter, I don’t want to develop any relationship with the hoster, I don’t want to listen to any odd news about the hoster’s family. And one more thing I hated is that they always want to say some negative understandings of China, I don’t want to say bad words to them, but they are actually the “ugly Chinese”, move out of China, and need to say some bad news about China so that they can feel a little bit better because they are the one that abandoned by their motherland. That’s why there is a big part of the foreign Chinese that hate China. They just need a REASON to live abroad or they will lose their living belief. [↑]</p>

<p>Well, it looks like some aggressive words, but they are the TRUTH, I have a clear view now after I meet a lot of Chinese here, especially the old ones that living here. I don’t want to end this with this negative content. So let me talk something about shopping. Last year, I really have a good experience with Amazon, they just like JD in China, the delivery speed is very fast, sometimes I can receive the product the next day. The main products I bought last year are shoes, MatePad, DjiMini2, and Redmi. I spent 8 hundred RMB on one pair of shoes, this is the first time for me to buy such expensive shoes, but the experience is just general, I don’t feel it has any MAGIC. Next is Huawei Matepad Pro, which is the most valuable electronic product I bought last year. It helped me finish almost all online meetings since my desktop computer always has some problems with the speaker. Also, MPP is a wonderful tool to watch videos, a fantastic way!  Then I bought Dji Mini2 from China at the end of November, but it took more than two weeks and still in China, so I canceled the order, and just bought it directly in the local online store. Unfortunately, the controller of the drone has a big problem, to exchange it, I negotiate with Dji and they finally help me finished the procedure of repairing it. After one week, they send me a new controller, the whole repairment process spent one month, but the service of Dji is not bad. Regarding Redmi, I just want to buy a candidate phone, since my Huawei phone had a network problem. It just cost several hundred RMB, but I’m shocked by the performance of its battery. I can use it for a really LONG time after one charging. [↑]</p>
<hr>
<p>Although I said last year is a boring and upsetting year, but as you can see, it was actually not bad, even in my study, last year, I finished the two Artesc courses about presentation and scientific writing. After that, I finished my first presentation with slides, and the feedback is good, which is out of my expectations. And this article is about 1900 words, I used about 3 hours to finish, which I think I have improved a lot and benefit a lot from the writing course. Last Monday, we just finished a paper about my research, actually, it’s the second paper since I also participate in another paper as co-author. </p>
<p>Long story short, last year is the PAST year, I can’t change anything that happed before, all I can do is to make things better as possible as I can. Now, the covid-19 is still a big problem that affects everyone here, but we all have used to live with it. Stay at home, and enjoy life, that’s also good from another positive perspective. </p>
