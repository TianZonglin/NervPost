It could include thousands of rows and columns, and usually, the items are all numerical numbers, which are hard to understand. Now, your task is to get information from it as much as possible. What can you do with the data? How could you find useful information from it? ExpositionThe general way is to compute some statistical features. But if you want to get a good comprehension of it, you need to find more meaningful features, like clustering information of rows and relationships between different columns. To do this, you can use some advanced methods like principal components analysis which is known as PCA. But the numerical result of these methods is still hard to understand. So, here we introduce visual signals while using these methods. For example, with PCA, you can get a squeezed result, which means the number of rows won’t change but columns could be compressed into 2 or 3. Since columns indicate dimensional information, you can say the dataset is transformed from high-dimension to low-dimension, which you can easily visualize as a scatterplot in the coordinate system. Now, you can get the scatterplot in which every row represents a point, and they could gather into different clusters. We naturally think these clusters are the clustering features of this dataset. And if you assign different colors into different clusters, then you can understand it immediately. Propelling MomentBut the question is that since PCA is just one of so many algorithms, how could you make sure the PCA could give you a proper result. Can you trust it? The short answer is No. We need a way to test it. Divergent Action PhaseHere we compute two kinds of neighbor errors by testing every point in the scatterplot. What are the neighbors? If points are located in a circle area around the one we selected, then we call them their neighbors.We use the classic Euclidean distance to find out all neighbors of each point in the low-dimension scatterplot and the original high-dimension data. Next, we can compare these two kinds of neighbors. For the point of low-dim scatterplots, if its neighbors don’t appear in high-dim data, then we call them false-neighbors. And if the points of low-dim scatterplots miss some neighbors of high-dim data, then we call these missing-neighbors. Crucial EventNow, we get important errors! that could tell you which part of the scatterplot we can trust and which part is totally wrong. Convergent Action PhaseThe next question is how to assign these error messages to our scatterplot? There are several ways to do it. We can use luminance to represent errors with the original scatterplot or we just generate a new scatterplot with colors to show errors.With the above methods, we could have several visual results of the original dataset. SolutionSo now, you have 3 views. Using the scatterplot of PCA, you 1can easily understand the clustering information. And with these error views, we can easily correct the former understanding. Actually, this kind of solution could be used as a general process, we can also compute other types of views to refine our understanding. CodaSo, you can see these visual methods able you to have a good comprehension of the table in a short time. That’s why we call it: understand complex tables in one minute!","link":"/words/8267.html"},{"title":"Some writing pitfalls","text":"Pitfalls are some dangerous areas that most people could stuck in when they write their words.

Absence of emphasisIf your sentence carries no emphasis the message reads like a futile message. Try to change the order of the messages or words in the sentence so emphasis gets back in. ArticlesNotably writers from Asia forget to use articles which are not present in their own language. Please mark articles in a newspaper text and become more aware of them in your own writing BracketsInformation between brackets is best avoided, unless it is a definition of an abbreviation. CommasCommas are ideally placed where you reader should breathe. If this is in your list of pitfalls you do not use them enough, or too often or at the wrong place. EE/endExcessive Endings: If you use double emphasis at the end of a sentence, the movement of the text disappears. If it is completely gone when the text should move on, it is an excessive ending [ee]. If the loss of movement is less severe we tend to add [end] in the text. The question is then if you wanted it to end or not. We doubt that it is the case. GrammarIf this is added in your text we wonder whether the sentence is grammatically correct. In that case expert help on grammar is a good idea, or you can use Grammarly to help you out. LongLong Sentences. Sentences longer than 24 words are difficult to read.

Most of them could be formatted into regular tables or datasheets, where the columns are called their dimensionalities. Researchers already have a lot of experience dealing with these datasets, but in the age of big data, the expansion of the number of dimensionalities (columns) is already made it big trouble for people to handle them. Researchers have created a huge amount of methods to reduce the dimensionality to let people could find insight information in an understandable way. The basic idea is to compute the importance of different dimensions and preserve the principle dimensionalities (PCA). If dimensionality reduced to 2 or 3, then we can understand them, because it’s easy to show them reduce data with 2D or 3D space. But the problem is the losing details could play a big role in the process of our understanding. How to find these missing messages or how to evaluate the result of dimensionality reduction has become a key problem. In other words, giving good explanations to these results is the final aim that we want to reach. With extra interactions, some methods could let people have global explanations by adding axes to the 2/3D space. But they can’t give much more local explanations, meanwhile, the existing methods that have local explanations are all heavily dependent on interactions.Thus, we introduced the image-based method to compute the local explanations. It allows users to get local explanations and could complete the computation in one time without extra interaction. We designed three models to compute the local information and finally created six methods to test. We used more than 20 datasets to test every method and gave detailed illustrations to these explanations we get. Using the intrinsic structure we have known, we verified the rationality of our explanations. Now, this research is still moving on, the future work will focus on the fluence of different parameters, and the evaluation methods for our explanations. With multiple good explanations we computed, we aim to give users more extra understanding so that guide them to choose the best dimensionality reduction method to handle their dataset.","link":"/words/32f0.html"},{"title":"Important rules in English writing","text":"Most young scientists have no clue how to organise their writing, let alone how to get it done.

This example shows how it’s done: This sentence comes to a halt, and that provides the space for a subclause, (pause) after which we can easily get back to the original sentence. Remember two things: You will never be able to write everything down, so you need to be selective anyway. The fact that what you write is true does not mean it should be included. Only write what you really need in order to tell the story. 4.Avoiding excessive lengthsome rules of thumb: A sentence is the expression of a single idea. You really need a good reason to make a sentence longer than a line and a half. If you can’t read it out loud in a single breath, it is probably too long. 5.Only giving necessary information [Original].

You can measure the density using either an optical probe or a density sensor. 12345either ... orneither ... nornot only ... but alsoboth ... andwhether ... or 7.Using commas to help the reader breathCommon uses of commas: Near the start of the sentence, often after an adverb or adverbial phrase (“However, it is still the best option” “By the way, let me know when you’re finished”) To ‘subordinate’, to indicate part of a sentence that is not grammatically necessary, but adds to the meaning, often making a comment on it. (“Everyone turned up, which was great, and was very happy, which was even better”) To separate two halves of a sentence (“If you want to go, I will stay here”) 8.Using natural rhythm8.1 Obnoxious beginnings &amp; excessive endings [Original]. L-arabinose and D-xylose are the most abundant monosaccharides in nature after D-glucose, being major constituents of the hemicelluloses xylan and xyloglucan, and of pectin. [Better].

The chemical compound Xylitol is the first common intermediate of the inter-comnected L- arabinose and D-xylose fungal catabolism. 8.2 Staccato Writing In spoken language emphasis is used in a regular way. In writing, this regularity can be disturbed, which leads to unnatural rhythm and difficult reading. The steps to tackle this problem are: Find the points where you trip over the text by reading it out loud.Circle the parts that carry substantial emphasis and look for local concentrations of emphases. Play with the order of words or add words that tend to speed up to make it more smooth. 8.3 Tail in the middle of the dog It best avoided as it causes the latter part of the sentence to come across like an unimportant side remark. The solution is either to remove the last part, or turn it into a new sentence. [Original]. Carbonyl sulphide is the most abundant sulphur containing trace gas in the atmosphere, with an average mixing of 500 parts per trillion. [Better].

Are easy to read out loudConflict induces in stories.Phase 1: The exposition In the Mr. Bean story the exposition starts at the beginning and goes to the point where he is eager to give a coin. (0:00-0:19 m:s) Phase 2: Propelling moment The propelling moment in Mr. Bean is less dramatic, but very effective. He wants to give a coin, but he only has a banknote! (0:19-0:22 m:s) Phase 3: Divergent Action Phase In the Mr. Bean clip the divergent action phase is of course much shorter. It consists of: being annoyed for not having a coin, trying to walk away, trying to find some change and finally getting stuck, because he has no options left. (0:22- 0:41 m:s) Divergence cannot go on for ever of course. If we keep stacking on problems, the story would never end. To reach a solution we need something that changes divergence into convergence. Some kind of key to solve the problem. Phase 4: Crucial Event In Mr. Bean he gets an idea ‘maybe I can earn a coin myself’. In Romeo and Juliet it is the moment that Romeo does not get the letter. Phase 5: Convergent Action Phase Mr. Bean gets the next idea when he finds his handkerchief, performs his unforgettable dance, and is given a coin by a woman passing by (0:42-1:08 m:s). If you’ve watched the movie and I’d stop there, you’d feel the tension. You want the conflict to be resolved and your desire fulfilled. You know it is just about to happen. But if I do not give it, you will feel the tension because you just love to surrender yourself to a story. Phase 6: Solution This is the moment the conflict is resolved. The Mr. Bean story does have a happy end and he solves the conflict by giving his coin at 1:08 m:s. Phase 7: Coda As we had to deal with a lot of action, trouble and conflict we want to stabilise the situation. To give us time to let go of the tension, we are presented with a bit of nothing. Perhaps some comic relief or a futile conflict from the start that gets solved, leading to a glorious ‘That’s allfolks’. The Mr. Bean story does have a happy end and he solves the conflict by giving his coin at 1:08 m:s. Applying stories in your papers ExpositionYou can of course the beginning of your introduction. ObstacleIn most cases you have an obstacle, otherwise you did not have to do all the work. Divergent Action PhaseThis feels a bit more tricky because we discovered it is about stacking problems, where the situation becomes more complicated and finally gets stuck. With your paper you need to realise that your divergent phase started in your introduction already. There is a default divergent quality in the part where you share what you are going to do, and which question and sub-questions you aim to answer, i.e. where you share an overview of your paper. The only challenge lies in writing the method section as it’s fairly dry. But there are enough divergent action options in your results and discussion section. Crucial EventThe only story feature you really need to turn the second half of your paper into a story is a crucial event. If you have a key insight, or an idea that leads you to solve the conflict, use it here. Convergent Action PhaseWhatever comes after that, can serve as a convergent phase. If you secretly add speed by increasing the event density in this part of your results and discussion section, you can suggest the speed of a converging part while everybody reads a ‘normal’results and discussion section. SolutionAnd finally you present your solution or conclusion to solve the conflict in your paper. Easy, as you do that in a paper anyway. CodaA look at possible future work is excellent material to build a coda with. Writing Process What is a sketch? A sketch can consist of a drawing or a table of contents for that specific section. Whatever it is, you need to have a clear idea what to write before you start the actual writing. If you have that idea, you can do a warming up to clear the pathway from your mind to the page. The easiest warm up is to write about any subject like your neighbours’ dog or the weather. Please write for a set time, and make sure you do not stop writing. When the flow of words stops, you repeat writing the last word again and again until new words start to flow again. That allows you to open up the path from your thoughts to the page.Once you’ve made a sketch and done your warm up, you write your text without correcting it. In the scheme it says ‘write crap’. To be clear, don’t write any crappier than you normally would. The point is to only focus on producing text and to accept anything that is not perfect. Imperfections are for the editing phase. The five phases in the writing processIn the end there is not one generic plan that is the best for everybody, just as writing is not a linear process. You go back and forth many times and that is good, because you do not know what you will write until you write it down. And with every polishing step you become wiser. Whatever the steps are in reality, you will always find that you iterate between the following five phases: The write before you do anything phaseIn which you make plans for your research. Writing will help you to make these plans concrete, tangible and clear enough to execute. The research phaseIn which you do your research and collect material to write about. It is possible to go back to the first phase to change your plans if necessary. The sketching phaseIn which you sketch your article in detail. The writing phaseIn which you do the actual writing. The editing phaseIn which you edit what you wrote.

Find a quiet place and select some words or objects you want to describe. It’s better to describe some scientific objects since we are training our scientific writing. Think about a word, and just write words, you can write craps but do not change it when you’re writing. Just keep writing until you think you can stop (about 300 words), then you can review what you’ve made, and modify it to the final version. VisualizationVisualization is a very scientific word, which could be seen in lots of papers and involved in almost every research area. The basic idea is to create images or visible objects to represent the numbers or text of the resource data. It is a kind of natural thinking that transfers the information into visual signals. Scientists have found that almost all information we get come from our vision, which means images, animes, or other types of visual objects are the fast way for humans to get information. In detail, the common visual signals include color, size, luminance, texture, etc. With these signals, we can deal with most vision problems. But the new challenge is how to handle the data that include hundreds even thousands of dimensions. Using statistical methods, researchers have created many algorithms to select the special dimensions from data, they can get lots of meaningful results with these methods, but unfortunately, they are all numbers or text, so these unreadable results lead this problem into the visualization field, which could perfectly return understandable results. From here, visualization became more and more important in the data analysis field, especially multidimensional data analysis. Nowadays it has become an independent research area and will continue to play a big role in every research field. Image-based methodWhen dealing with the dimensional data, images always used to represent the final project result. It could show some information like clusters, density, or overlappings. But that’s all comes from the image itself, we can’t get any information from the original data once we get the final image. If we want to build a mapping between them, like using an area in an image to finding the matching points in resource data. The traditional methods usually need to create a structure to store all point location, which is very complex and only support a small number of points. In this kind of case, Image-based methods could have a good performance. For most scatterplots, the images are generated by the real result of algorithms, the key point is that there is a connection for every point between numbers and images. We can use this kind of connection to solve the above question. With the pixels computing, it could execute with a fast speed and don’t need much middle control since it runs the same operations for each point. Web application(not about research, just something different) Nowadays, web applications have become a very important part of our daily life. What is the web application, compared with traditional applications, it should not contains heavy back-end components, and should easy enough to build and deploy. Specifically, they usually programmed by pure front-end languages like Javascript/Html/CSS or introduce the support of back-end with Nodejs, Vue, or React. For the most front-end developer, build a complex environment is always the boring and annoying part when they want to write and publish something. Find an easy way to do that is a common idea for every one of them. Now some public service producer like Github and Vercel has supported the hosting service that allows users to deploy their static resources on the servers. This is a big step, which means without building any servers by themself, and publish their content on the Internet. Now, not only the programmer, but also lots of students, bloggers, or companies start to use this service to show their content on this freeway. Unfortunately, there is no service to support the back-end for Github or Vercel. At the same time, Glitch appeared and brought a brand new service, which allows users to create applications with Nodejs. Besides, they also have an online coding system that could edit and publish with the browser. When users create an application, Glitch will start a docker service. With this kind of virtual technique, they could support building thousands of applications every day. This is a really amazing service, that could let a big group of people program a more complex project without any local environment.","link":"/words/1489.html"},{"title":"Cut off the tail [redundant parts]","text":"This is a training for shorten your words. Writing craps could help us make enough words in a short time. But now we need to focus inside: cut off the sentences or descriptions that are not related to your writing objects. Training this with three phrases: write 300 words to describe one thing, then shorten it to 200 words, and finally 100 words. Compare these three versions you can find the strange parts in your words. Phrase A - 300 wordsIn order to compute the similarity between the low dimensional projections and high dimensional source datasets, we create a way to connect them. Since we know that the process of dimensionality reduction is like a black box, so it is hard to find out the match point of the source dataset in projections. Thus we used an inverse way to build the matching. In 2D projections, we can combine the pixels information with every point. Then, for each point, we can find the matching point or items in the source dataset. Because we have all information with the source data, we can achieve this by programming. After doing that, we connected the points in low and high dimensions. Next, what we did is to compute similarity. Based on the same idea, we still focus on the low dimensional projection. We select one point/pixel, and compute a circle area around this point When we get the neighborhoods, we find all of their matching points. Finally, we used Euclidean distance to compute these two sets of points. Besides, considering the process of computing are almost same as the variance computing, so we also create methods based on variance. Now, we have built a new brilliant mechanism to compute similarity. The next step is to test the way to compute distance. We choose more than 10 datasets and made a set of experiments for the case study later. After getting our explanations, we tried to explain what our explanations showed. From our test, we found a suitable range for parameters for most cases we tested.
